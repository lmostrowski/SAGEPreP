# SAGEPreP
SAGEPrep: Semi-Automated GUI-based EEG Preprocessing. EEG data are typically contaminated with artifacts (e.g., by eye movements, electrical contamination, and facial muscle movements), that must be removed from the data prior to analysis. Manual artifact rejection methods are largely time-consuming when applied to high-density or long-duration EEG data. Here, we present a semi-automated method to identify and delete temporal and spatial artifacts from EEG data. This pipeline utilizes parameters from the FASTER (Fully Automated Statistical Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection) pipeline, with the addition of a user-friendly GUI and additional checkpoints for the reviewer to supervise artifact classification. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate EEG data into neural activity and artifact. The semi-automated approach is particularly helpful with large datasets, and is designed to streamline manual review and target specific causes of artifact.
